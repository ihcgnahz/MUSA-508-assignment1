get_acs()目前仅支持获取至2018年的数据
所以我们的对比是Los Angeles City 2009 VS 2018

Target: Los Angeles County, CA
- State code: 06
- County code: 037

1. Show your data wrangling work.
2. Four small-multiple (2000 & 2017+) visualizations comparing four selected Census variables across time and space (TOD vs. non-TOD).
3. One grouped bar plot making these same comparisons.
4. One table making these same comparisons.
5. Create two graduated symbol maps of population and rent within 0.5 mile of each transit station. Google for more information, but a graduate symbol map represents quantities -for each transit station proportionally.
6. Create a geom_line plot that shows mean rent as a function of distance to subway stations (Figure x.x.x). To do this you will need to use the multipleRingBuffer function in the ppaR package.
7. Download and wrangle point-level crime data (pick a crime type). What is the relationship between crime, transit access and rents?
